    <p>Crowd control</p>
    <p class="para">The project utilizes the MobileNet SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector)
      model, which is a popular deep learning-based object detection model. The
      model is pre-trained on a large dataset and capable of detecting various
      objects, including people. It is implemented using the OpenCV library,
      which provides a convenient interface for working with computer vision
      tasks.
